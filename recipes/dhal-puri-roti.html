            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>

            <li>1/8 teaspoon instant yeast optional</li>

        <h4>For Cooking</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup vegetable oil for cooking roti</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <h4>To make filling</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a saucepan with 12 cups water and place over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Pick through and discard any stones or debris. Rinse split peas, rubbing between fingers, until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>Add to the  pot along with salt and turmeric and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Cook for 20-30  minutes or until dhal is cooked and firm (not soft) and crushes easily between thumb and forefinger with no grainy feel.</li>
            <li>Drain thoroughly and allow it to cool and dry.</li>
            <li>Add garlic, hot pepper and bandhania to the bowl of the food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Set aside and wipe bowl as added moisture will make the split peas unmanageable.</li>
            <li>Add 1/3 split pease to the bowl of the food processor (or food mill) along with the garlic, hot pepper and bandhania and pulse to mince, scraping down the sides of the bowl at intervals to ensure even processing.Do not over mince into a paste! Transfer to a dish and repeat 2 more times with the remaining split peas. </li>
            <li>To the bowl with the ground split peas, add cumin, salt, garlic, pepper and bandhania paste and mix well to combine.</li>
            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large heavy bottomed pot over high heat, add ground split peas and cook for 3-5 minutes until light and grainy, stirring constantly to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>The prep for the split peas can be done in advance and portioned out and kept in the freezer in small tightly closed resealable freezer bags. It will stay in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. The split peas usually makes enough filling for 8 cups of flour.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>To Make Dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, add flour, baking powder, sugar and salt.</li>
            <li>Mix to combine and gradually add lukewarm water and squeeze dough between fingers to bring it together. Knead for 3 minutes. You want a soft doughâ€”not as shaggy as buss up shot and not as firm as sada roti. Somewhere in between. Rub 1 tbs oil all over the dough and place in bowl and let rest for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Assembling</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate dough into 4 balls. Then separate each into two equal pieces. Form into small balls (making 8 balls). You can make 6 if you have a large tawa.</li>
            <li>Working with one piece of dough at a time, press and flatten each into a round 4-5 inch disk. Place 1/4 cup of dhal onto the disk and stretch the edges over and around the ground dhal to meet at the top, then press together or pinch the dough tightly to seal.</li>
            <li>Dust with flour and press all the way around to evenly disperse filling. Place on a floured counter and cover.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining dough until all are filled. Many times it is ready to be rolled out immediately and does not require resting. Prolonged resting and make it difficult to manage since it becomes too soft and the dough is at risk of breaking while rolling out.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Cooking</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat and oil tawa, flat iron griddle or a 10 - 12 inch cast iron skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, dust counter and rolling pin with flour. Take one of the loyahs and gently flatten with your fingers. Starting from the center of the dough, roll out using a rolling pin, pushing outwards, then down, turning dough 90 degrees angle several times and flipping and repeating turning until it is a flat, even circle(about 1/8 inch thick and as wide as your tawa or pan), ensuring that the edges are also even. Amateurs: please do not roll out too thin which can cause breakage and seepage of filling. Keep it well floured at all times.</li>
            <li>Pick up the dough and gently place it on the tawa (or alternative) by flipping and rotating your wrists. Allow it to cook for 15-20 seconds, brush with oil and immediately flip. Brush again with oil and allow it to cook for another 15 - 30 seconds, then flip and cook for another  30 - 45 seconds, pressing edges with the back of the spoon to ensure that they are cooked.</li>
            <li>Remove with the handle of a spoon, dabla or spatula  and place in a
            large bowl lined with paper towel, kitchen towel or brown paper bags to
            absorb any excess oil. If at any time the the roti browns too quickly or
            the tawa starts smoking, reduce the heat. Alternately, if nothing seems
            to be happening raise heat.</li>
            <li>Repeat rolling out and cooking until all are cooked. Enjoy!</li>
