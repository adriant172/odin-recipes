        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>In this curry chicken recipe, a whole chicken (other pieces can be used) is first cut up and washed with the juice of a lime or lemon. Then, it's marinated with a blend of fresh herbs and lots of garlic, which we refer to as green seasoning in Trinidad. The curry is then cooked until it is no longer raw and to develop the flavors before adding the chicken. Simmered until the flavors develop into a phenomenal-cohesive-combination, it can be eaten with paratha roti, sada roti, dhal and rice or stewed red beans and rice. We eat it for lunch or dinner in Trinidad and, depending on how hungry you are- having it for breakfast is not objectionable either! The curry powder, cumin and the abundance of fresh herbs in this dish make it not only delicious but super healthy!</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <h4>Prep</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Make Green Seasoning: In a food processor or blender(or chop COARSELY by hand), mince scallion, cilantro/culantro, thyme, garlic and onion(not the reserved slices) and peppers. (You may choose not to add the onion to the blender but keep it sliced). Set aside 1 tablespoon of the Green Seasoning for the curry paste below.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare Chicken: Wash chicken with lemon juice, removing excess fat. Drain well. Season chicken with salt, pepper and the remainder of the Green Seasoning. Allow it to marinate for several hours or overnight(OPTIONAL).
            </li>
            <li>Make Curry Paste: In a small bowl, add 3-4 tablespoons curry powder, 4 tablespoons water and 1 tablespoon of the reserved Green Seasoning. Mix well. Set aside.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Cook Curry</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a heavy bottomed pot or dutch oven over medium heat, heat oil, add the reserved pieces of onions and pepper and cook until golden brown. Add curry mixture and cook until grainy and curry separates from the oil, stirring constantly and scraping bottom of pot to prevent it from sticking and burning, 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add seasoned chicken to pot. Stir to mix well. Add cumin, salt and pepper if you haven't already. If using potatoes, add now.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the pot and cook on medium heat until the meat has relinquished its juices and subsequently evaporates about 15-20 minutes, gently stirring every 5-7 minutes or so in a basting motion (pouring the pan juices over the chicken).</li>
            <li>When the liquid has evaporated, continue to stir fry for a few seconds(or up to 2 mins) allowing the flavors to develop and scraping the bottom of the pot with the spoon to prevent it from burning. Then add 2 cups of water.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, lower heat to medium, cover pot and cook until sauce has thickened about 5-10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Taste test for salt and add more if required. Enjoy with roti or rice.</li>
        </ol>
