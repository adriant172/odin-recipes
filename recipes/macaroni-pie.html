        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>In this recipe cooked pasta is mixed with two types of cheese, milk and seasonings and baked until firm, much like a corn casserole, then cut into squares. It is traditionally served alongside callaloo, stewed chicken and a salad for a typical Trinidadian Sunday lunch.</p>

        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>9 x 12 inch baking dish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb uncooked pasta 16 oz , <em>elbow or bucatini</em></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt for<em>boiling pasta</em></li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter<em>room temperature</em></li>
            <li>1 lb sharp or extra sharp cheddar cheese<em>shredded</em></li>
            <li>1 lb mozzarella <em>shredded</em></li>
            <li>2 ½ cups evaporated milk <em>or heavy cream</em></li>
            <li>2 eggs<em>whisked (optional)</em></li>
            <li>2 teaspoons granulated garlic <em>or 2 cloves garlic, minced</em></li>
            <li>2 teaspoons onion powder <em>or 1 small onion, minced</em></li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup <em>optional (but I highly recommend!)</em></li>
            <li>2 teaspoons yellow mustard</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Habanero <em>finely chopped, seeded or unseeded, or hot sauce--optional</em></li>
            <li>2 Fresh Pimento Peppers <em>chopped, optional</em></li>
            <li>2 tsp green seasoning <em>optional</em></li>
        </ul>
         
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using the large side of box grater or a food processor, shred both types of cheese.</li>
            <li>Mix together and divide in half.</li>
            <li>In a bowl (or large measuring cup), mix eggs, milk, garlic powder, onion powder, ketchup, mustard, pimento pepper(hot pepper and green seasoning if using) and black pepper (also add hot pepper or hot sauce and green seasoning if using).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water (4 to 5 quarts) to a rapid boil. Add 1 tablespoon salt and pasta. Stir for the first minute or two to prevent sticking. Cook until al dente and drain(about 8-10 minutes). While pasta is still very hot, place it into the same pot it was boiled in. Add butter and mix until melted.</li>
            <li>Add half of cheese and mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in milk and egg mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour into a glass greased baking/casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Top with remaining half of grated cheese.</li>
            <li>Place in a preheated oven (350 degrees Farenheit) and cook until golden brown, about 30-45 minutes(took 43 minutes in my oven).</li>
            <li>Allow it to cool(or try your darndest), cut into squares...and pray for discipline.....</li>
        </ol>
